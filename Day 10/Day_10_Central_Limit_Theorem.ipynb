In this scenario, that investor may simply study a random sample of stocks to cultivate estimated returns of the total index. To be safe, at least 30-50 randomly selected stocks across various sectors should be sampled for the central limit theorem to hold. Furthermore, previously selected stocks must be swapped out with different names to help eliminate bias."
